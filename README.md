# loyalty-card-demo

![demo.gif](./demo.gif)

- Frontend: React + Apollo Client (queries/mutations, live dashboard UI).

- Backend: Node.js + Express + Apollo Server, connected to MongoDB (remote cluster like Atlas).

- REST APIs: still exposed from backend alongside GraphQL.

- Use case: a ‚ÄúLive Loyalty Dashboard‚Äù (since you mentioned loyalty cards before, let‚Äôs stick with that‚Äîit‚Äôs simple but realistic).

üîπ Use Case: Live Loyalty Dashboard

A customer loyalty dashboard for store managers.

- They can see all customers and their points balance.

- They can add transactions (earn/spend points).

- They get real-time updates on balances (via GraphQL subscriptions).

- There‚Äôs also a REST API for legacy clients to fetch a single user‚Äôs balance.
